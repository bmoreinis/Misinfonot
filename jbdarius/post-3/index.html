<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0"><p>Over at Arts and Entertainment, Dan Zak has your full recap of President Obama's appearance on Jerry Seinfeld's “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.”

Here's the quote that stood out to us:

“I curse. I curse. ... Bad stuff, or stupid stuff, is happening constantly, right? Every day. So you have to be able to just make fun of a lot of that. Like ‘that was even dumber and more annoying than usual.’ That’s when cursing is really valuable.”</p>
<p This, of course, isn't altogether surprising. Obama has been shown on camera calling Kanye West a “jackass” for his award-show antics, he mused during the BP oil spill that he needs to figure out “whose ass to kick,” and venerated former ABC reporter Ann Compton has said she has seen Obama go on a profane tirade in a meeting with reporters.</p>

<p>And Obama is, of course, hardly the first president to swear; anyone who has heard the Richard Nixon tapes or is familiar with Lyndon B. Johnson’s penchant for folksy/vulgar language could tell you that. Even conservative Christian George W. Bush was caught on a hot mic during his presidency calling a New York Times reporter a “major-league [expletive].”

But it is still somewhat interesting to see the leader of the free world not only admitting he curses frequently, but that he endorses the practice as a stress-reliever.</p><p> This deep fake, a false image or video that seems deceptively real, by the American actor and director Jordan Peele, shows former US president Barack Obama speaking about the dangers of false information and fake news. Jordan Peele transferred his own facial movements to Obama’s facial characteristics using deep fake technology.
