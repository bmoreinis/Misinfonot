              <h1>Terrified Students Convinced Their Teachers are Aliens</h1>

              <h3>Teachers have been replaced by aliens, and are refusing to enter their classrooms.</h3>
          </div>

<h4><i>By Bailey and Jazzmin</i></h4>
          
<p> It all began with a post on Snapchat, where a student took a photo of a teacher with the caption “Mr. Anderson is not Mr. Anderson!” After following up with a TikTok video, the post spread rapidly throughout the student body.

 The plan succeeded. It was all the students were talking about the next day, after going home to check their feeds. Students who said they were too afraid to go to their classrooms stayed in the halls, running from any adults who tried to approach them and screaming. </p>
<p> A few students decided to take matters into their own hands. Some began to set traps for the alien teachers, using shoelaces and drawstrings from their hoodies. Others tried to call 911 from school phones, which did not call out. Others fashioned makeshift weapons out of paper clips and rubber bands.

 At this point, the author of the viral post came clean and took all responsibility. He turned himself in to the office, got on the intercom, and explained everything. He was also given permission to get on Snapchat and admit it was all a lie.</p>
<p> While the invasion of the teacher body-snatchers will be a fun memory for many students, this incident shows how quickly misinformation spreads among children.

A major source of misinformation for middle school students is TikTok, with more than a third of US users are under 14 (NYTimes). Tweens get fed lies fast on that platform (Newsweek)..</p>
