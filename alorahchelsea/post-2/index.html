              <h3>State of Florids starts micomanaging what goes into social studies textbooks</h3>
          </div>

<h5><i>Judd Legum</i></h5>
          
<p>By June 10, publishers of social studies textbooks are required to submit their materials to the Florida Department of Education for review. Textbooks that meet state requirements will be available for schools to use in K-12 social studies classes in the 2022-23 school year. </p>
					
<p>According to guidance released by the Florida Department of Education, social studies textbooks must not include any component of "social justice." Lessons related to social justice, the guidance states, "may lead to student indoctrination."</p>
          
<p>Social justice is not comprehensively defined in the Florida Department of Education guidance. But one component of social justice, according to the Florida Department of Education, is "seeking to eliminate undeserved disadvantages for selected groups." 

<p>Is is possible, however, to teach social studies — a topic which explores how society developed and functions — without covering any efforts to "eliminate undeserved disadvantages for selected groups"? Popular Information reached out to Anton Schulzki, President of the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS), "the largest professional association in the country devoted solely to social studies education," to find out. In addition to his current role as President of NCSS, Schulzki has taught social studies in Colorado Springs, Colorado since 1983.</p>

<p>Schulzki was unconvinced that teachers could provide a rigorous social studies education without addressing issues of social justice. Schulzki told Popular Information that social justice "goes hand-in-hand with teaching civil rights," which is a central component of a social studies curriculum.</p> 

<p>Schulzki said that he believes "students should have the opportunity to take a look at a full picture of US history and/or world history" and that involves learning about "social justice movements." Topics that have been frequently included in his classes over the years include "voting rights," "the right to an equal and fair education," "civil rights for African Americans," and "civil rights for women." The point of introducing these topics is not to indoctrinate students politically. Schulzki said that social studies teachers "want our students to learn to ask really good questions, and to know that their social studies teachers don't always have the answers." </p>

<p>Policy makers that impose prohibitions on topics like social justice in the classroom, Schulzki noted, "spend little or no time going to schools." Teachers, he said, should not be prohibited from covering important topics because "somebody found the notion of words 'social justice' to be something that they don't agree with."</p>

<p>The interests of students and teachers, however, appear to be taking a backseat to the interest of Governor Ron DeSantis (R) in using the Florida Department of Education to advance his political agenda. </p>

<h3>The problem with banning Critical Race Theory</h3>
          
<p>DeSantis claims that Critical Race Theory (CRT), an academic theory about how racism is embedded in legal structures, is being taught in Florida's K-12 schools. DeSantis benefits politically by championing new laws banning CRT in schools and "protecting" children from radical indoctrination. </p>

<p>The problem with banning CRT in K-12 schools, however, is that it is not taught in K-12 schools. It is taught in law school. So if all you did was ban CRT in K-12 schools it would quickly die as a political issue. </p>

<p>DeSantis ran into this problem earlier this year when he claimed several math textbooks for Florida elementary schools students contained "race essentialism," DeSantis' shorthand for CRT. Weeks later, the reviews of the textbooks released by the Florida Department of Education revealed that DeSantis' claim was a complete fabrication. </p>

<p>So Florida has started to ban other topics that it claims are CRT in disguise. The state first pivoted to banning Social Emotional Learning (SEL). But SEL is not equivalent to CRT. SEL focuses on the development of "critical thinking, emotion management, conflict resolution, decision making, [and] teamwork" — skills that are necessary for students to excel in school and in life. The term dates back to 1997 but the concept of character development dates back at least to Benjamin Franklin in the mid-1700s.</p>

<p>The state's guidelines for math textbooks banned SEL. This meant the state began rejecting textbooks for encouraging students to learn how to “work together” when doing math and to "listen to our friends and teachers."</p>
